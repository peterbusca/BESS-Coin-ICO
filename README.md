# Green BESS-Coin - GBC ICO
Being independent - take the energy turnaround into your own hands   Green BESS Coin makes it possible - carefree shopping with your own wallet - The Green BESS Coin is underpinned by the power production of Green Energy, Automatic High Performance BESS power plants with own Blockchains combined with Fotovoltaic/vertcal Wind Power. 
GBC ICO are the first ICOs worldwide, based on Ethereumplatform, that serve as vouchers against the installation and use of BESS power plants (hardware) that are generated in Europe, preferably in Germany. BESS power plants are decentralized power supply units for the integration of Renewable Energy Sources RES. Every single BESS Power Plant is equipped with Blokchaine plus redundancies. The Green BESS Coin is underpinned by the power production of hundreds of own Clean Power Plants. BESS power plants worldwide are in demand for the integration of renewable energy sources RES - https://www.greenbesscoin.com/

 The Green Bess Coin> GBC The instrument that exclusively for Financing:
“Green Energy Power Plants, Photovoltaic - Wind Power - Self -Thinking BESS power plants is used.

The "Disruptive High Performance Technology of BESS Power Plant ™ + own" Blockchain Technology "for the integration of" Renewable Energy Sources "RES” into existing power grids is the Special USP Asset, which turns conventionally static, intelligent and dynamic storage power plants!

The problem of Renewable Energy Sources "RES" in the distribution networks
Due to nature, electricity generation from the sun and wind is irregular, including electricity consumption.
Renewable energy sources (RES) are volatile due to nature, the more they are fed into electrical networks, the more "Controll Reserve Power CRP" the network managers need to keep electricity demand with the natural current generation in balance (frequency 50 Hertz in Europe). If the 50 Hertz frequency is not adhered to, machines and devices get out of function to the blackout of the power grids (hours of power failure!). more info.

In order to avoid these technical problems, the control power market was introduced in Germany in 2008, which has been extended to all EU neighboring states since 2016. Until 2011, this instrument worked, the feed -in of RES was around 18.25%. With the increase in the RES in the power nets, however, the RES feeds were forced to limit. Because on the one hand, there was not sufficient CRP (Control Reserve Power) and on the other hand, the prices on the control power market for CRP have increased uncontrollably, but the total costs of which are exposed to  the electricity price is overturned and ensures that energy prices are steadily increasing 

The solution - self -thinking, automated High Performance BESS Kraftwerk ™ with 3 applications, developed by Bioenergon Green Energy, reduce prices to the lowest stand on the control power market and can replace the control market in the high gigawatt area with reasonable prices! Furthermore, the BESS Power Plant can also supply the EU citizens with RES at economic prices.- EU Law "Cleen Energy for All Europeans"-.

100% Green Energy All Over The World to Save Our Blue Planet

 Expansion of green infrastructure projects 4.0 - sustainable and long –term

The investment and the EU expansion of many Green Energy Power Plants for the entire UCTE network should significantly accompany the green investment wave of photovoltaic’s and wind turbines and increase them sustainably by their efficiency! By providing intelligent Clean Energy BES power plants, the regenerative energy sources can feed up to 100% of their power output into the network instead of 70% (as of today). Due to this enormous increase in efficiency, the electricity market changes radically in the long term:

	up to 40% higher load of renewable energy sources
	higher economy of every system
	Bess power plants stabilize the power grids and replace expensive gas power plants as a reserve
	Leads to favorable and long -term stable energy prices

100% GBC value protection by over € 100 million property betting

The Green Bess Coin >GBC< - ICO  until the commissioning of every “Green Energy BESS power plants”, including Photovoltaic and Wind Power Plants, is physically secured by means of valuable properties with a total value of over 100 million Euros.
